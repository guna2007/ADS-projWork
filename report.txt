Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Logistic Regression and SVM

Introduction
The aim of this project is to analyze the PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset and build two simple predictive models for diabetes classification. Descriptive analytics was done first to understand data patterns. Two predictive models were applied which were not discussed in class: Logistic Regression and SVM.

Dataset Description
The dataset has 768 rows and 9 columns. Outcome is the target column.
Attributes are Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, Outcome.

Descriptive Analysis
Histograms and boxplots show spread and outliers. Correlation heatmap shows Glucose and BMI are strongly related to diabetes. The outcome distribution shows more non-diabetic cases than diabetic.

Predictive Models
Two models used:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine with linear kernel

Train test split was 80:20 after normalization.

Performance Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC used.
Logistic Regression is simpler and interpretable. SVM gives different margins and sometimes slightly better separation.

Observations
Higher glucose levels strongly indicate positive outcome.
BMI also shows notable separation.
Age has moderate impact.
Dataset imbalance affects recall slightly.

Conclusion
Both models work reasonably for early diabetes detection. Good basic learning for understanding model comparison and medical feature relations. Future work could include balancing methods or more models if needed.
